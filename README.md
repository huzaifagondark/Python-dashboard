PYTHON GRAPHICAL DASHBOARD USING TKINTER AND MATPLOTLIB:

In my quest to automate biostatistics, I created the dataset and got the relevant graphs

but the main challenge was to showcase all the graphs in the same window or dashboard

To solve this I came across two wonderful modules of Python Tkinter and Matplotlib

Tkinter for graphical user interface (GUI)

Matplotlib for plotting the graphs of the dataset

To understand the logic behind it, a dummy dataset using dictionaries was created ( the data can be taken from Excel also by openpyxl or pandas)

I plot the graphs for each dataset differently and fuse them by the FigureCanvasTkAgg property into my dashboard...
